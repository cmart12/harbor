 * silently read/wrote a *different* folder — making saved settings (e.g. a
 * persona's `yolo` flag) appear not to persist across restarts/upgrades.

 * `app.getPath('userData')` at module-load time. The build is CommonJS, so
 * importing this module *first* in main.ts guarantees the path is pinned before
